#Important

`parsing/data/areas.txt` & `parsing/data/counties.txt` normally contain a php serialised list of areas and counties, which would allow you to reduce the number of network calls to the Daft API. I have removed these here so as to not host private Daft data. The Daft API terms are available here: http://api.daft.ie/terms/terms.daft. The following paragraph is important:

"You must not pre-fetch, cache, or store any results or related data from the Daft API, except that you may store: (i) limited amounts of results for the purpose of improving the performance of your authorised application if you do so temporarily, securely, and in a manner that does not permit use of the content outside of the authorised application; and (ii) any content identifier or key that the Daft API Documentation specifically permits you to store. For example, you must not use the results to create an independent database of properties."
